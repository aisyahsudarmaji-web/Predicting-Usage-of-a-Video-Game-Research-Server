    "## (1) DATA DESCRIPTION   \n",
    "**Context**: A research group in UBC computer science, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data about how people play video games. They set up a Minecraft server, and they need to target their recruitment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set \"players.csv\" has 196 players and 7 variables, and contains information about players who participated in UBC's Minecraft Research Project. Each row represents an individual player. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Description**  \n",
    "1. **experience**: The player's experience level in Minecraft (type: character) \n",
    "2. **subscribe**: Indicates whether or not the player subscribed to the game (type: logical)\n",
    "3. **hashedEmail**: The player's anonymous identity (type: character)\n",
    "4. **played_hours**: The number of hours the player spent playing on the server (type: double)\n",
    "5. **name**: The player's name (type: character)\n",
    "6. **gender**: The player's gender (type: character)\n",
    "7. **Age**: The player's age (type: double)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable **played_hours** is our response variable. It represents the number of hours a player has spent on the Minecraft server. By examining other variables, we can gain insights into the type of players that would contribute to the data set the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (2) QUESTIONS  \n",
    "**Broad question:**  \n",
    "Which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific question:**   \n",
    "Can a player's experience level (**experience**), subscription status (**subscribe**), gender (**gender**), and age (**Age**) predict the number of hours players would play on the server? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be using the columns \"hashedEmail\" and \"name\" as they don't provide useful information for the prediction."

KNN would look at the most similar players based on their characteristics (experience, subscribe, gender), and calculate the average of their play hours.
