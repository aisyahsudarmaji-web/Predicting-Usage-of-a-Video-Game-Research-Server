    "\n",
    "While we're trying to predict the \"kinds\" of players who would contribute a large amount of data, our analysis would have to involve the number of hours players play on the server, which is numerical. As such, KNN regression would be a suitable method, especially knowing that the relationship between the number of hours played versus the players' characteristics may not be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the KNN regression method, we need to assume that the distance between points must represent similarity. KNN would look at the most similar players (nearest) based on their characteristics (age, gender, experience), and calculate the average of their play hours. However, there might be some limitations. A limitation would be the fact that our model may not predict well beyond the range of values input in our training data (e.g., a player's age beyond the range). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying the model, I will split the data into the training (75%) and test set (25%). The training data will be used to train the model, and I will keep the test aside for evaluating how well the model perform on unseen data at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will compare the KNN regression model by testing different values of k through cross-validation. The model's performance will be evaluated by calculating its RMSE, which measures the difference between the predicted vs actual number of hours played. The K value with the lowest RMSE would be used for the final model."
